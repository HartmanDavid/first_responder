# first_responder
First Responder app built on Meteor

This first responder app is designed to assist people in emergency situations receive aid faster. 
There is no nationwide standard for measuring emergency response times. A USA TODAY study of the 50 biggest U.S. cities found that most cities report only the slice of the response time: the emergency crew's drive time to the scene. On many emergency runs, that is just a fraction of the total time before 911 aid arrives.

USA TODAY's investigation found more than 1,000 "saveable" lives are lost needlessly each year in the nation's biggest cities because of inefficiencies in the cities' emergency medical systems. At the root of these inefficiencies in many cases is the simple matter Cities relying on a busy dispatch center or crews park with poor sceen location and directions.

First Responder looks to use todays social technology to change this.
